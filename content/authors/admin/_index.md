      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network‚Äôs architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Welcome to my professional website! I am a Digital Humanities Analyst/Data Scientist at the Data Science and Analytics Unit of Arizona State University (ASU). I hold a PhD in Political Science from ASU‚Äôs School of Politics and Global Studies, M.A. in International Relations and Dialogue Studies from Keele University, UK, and a B.A. in Regional Studies and Economic Sciences from Baku Engineering University (former Qafqaz University) in Azerbaijan. My research focuses on conflict and peace with an interdisciplinary emphasis on climate change and sustainability. I utilize both conventional machine learning methods and Transformer-based AI models, to predict civil conflict and analyze peace agreements. My current key projects include the use of LLMs for qualitative research, a survival analysis of ceasefires and war recurrence, survival-based machine learning approach to predicting civil war recurrence, and research project using LLMs such as BERT and T5 to predict the success of peace agreements based on their text. In my book project, I develop custom Transformer-based language models, including fine-tuned versions of BERT and RoBERTa, to analyze homophobic political and media discourse in authoritarian regimes. My contributions have been recognized with the Open Science Foundation Award. Methodologically, I aim to combine traditional statistical approaches with conventional NLP, classic machine learning, and Transformer-based AI models. My articles have been published in Political Research Quarterly, Foreign Policy Analysis, Problems of Post-Communism, Nations and Nationalism, Asia-Europe Journal, Caucasus Survey, and Middle East Policy.
