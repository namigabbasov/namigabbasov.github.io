      title: 'My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research focuses on conflict and peace, with an interdisciplinary emphasis on climate change and sustainability. I integrate conventional machine learning techniques and Transformer-based AI models to predict civil conflict and analyze peace agreements.
        
        Methodologically, I combine traditional statistical methods with classical NLP, machine learning, and advanced Transformer-based AI approaches. My contributions have been recognized with the Open Science Foundation Award.
        
        My research has been published in Political Research Quarterly, Foreign Policy Analysis, Problems of Post-Communism, Nations and Nationalism, Asia-Europe Journal, Caucasus Survey, and Middle East Policy.
        
        My current projects include:
          - Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for qualitative research.
          - Exploring generative AI adoption in academia.
          - Conducting survival analysis of ceasefires and war recurrence.
          - Applying survival-based machine learning approaches to forecast civil war recurrence.
          - Using models like BERT and T5 to predict the success of peace agreements based on their textual content.
          - As part of my book project, I develop custom Transformer-based language modelsâ€”including fine-tuned versions of BERT and RoBERTaâ€”to analyze homophobic political and media discourse in authoritarian regimes.
